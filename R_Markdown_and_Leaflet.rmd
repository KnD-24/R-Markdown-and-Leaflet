## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet


#### Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

#### Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

#### Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r leaflet, echo=True}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=14.080062, lng=-60.945513, popup="Shawarma")
my_map
```
